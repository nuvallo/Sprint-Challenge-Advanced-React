- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
  <!--
    function components is mostly plain JavaScript functions
  -->
- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
  <!--
    componentDidMount is the phase when the component is being built
    componentDidUpdate is useful to perform some action when the state changes
    render is the most used lifecycle method. render handles the rendering of your component
  -->
- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
  <!--
    hooks unlock a whole new way to write functional components by allowing you to add features available to class components such as stateful logic
   -->
- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?
  <!--
    Surfaces bugs faster.
    Reduces the risk of regressions.
    Allows us to trust the code.
    Makes us think about the edge cases.
    Acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring.
    Acts as documentation for the code.
    Encourages us to write more testable (better!) code.
